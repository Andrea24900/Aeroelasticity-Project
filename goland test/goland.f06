     Depending on the context, these messages may indicate modeling
     problems. The threshold may be changed with the parameter MAXRATIO,
     however, the user is cautioned against arbitrarily increasing the
     MAXRATIO value just to get the model to run.  The cause of large
     MAXRATIOs should be investigated.
  
     This message is also generated (though the text is slightly different)
     when a Sturm check is performed during eigenvalue extraction. For this
     case, the message does not generally indicate a modeling problem.

 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 4648 (REIG)
    THE MODAL MASS MATRIX IS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE.
    User information:
    The modal mass matrix cannot be decomposed by the Cholesky algorithm
    after merging elastic and free-body modes.  (Cholesky decomposition is
    used to orthogonalize the eigenvectors with respect to the mass matrix.)
    Causes include the input of negative masses and the calculation of
    eigenvectors for eigenvalues approaching machine infinity.  Inspect
    Inspect the model or ask for fewer eigenvectors using of the F2 option.
    When this condition occurs, the eigenvectors are not orthogonalized
    r normalized. The second parameter of the READ or REIGL module is given
    a negative sign. This parameter is used in the solution sequences to
    branch to an error exit after printing the real eigenvalue table.
    You may use a DMAP Alter to print these eigenvectors if the cause
    of the problem is not apparent in the eigenvalues. The solution can be
    forced to completion by changing the sign of this parameter.  You
    should be aware that a poor quality of solution is provided for this
    case.  This poor solution may be useful for diagnosing the problem but
    should not be used for other purposes.
  
    The error can occur when large offsets (large relative to the element
    length) are used for the BEAM element and coupled mass is selected.

     User information:
     This indicates that eigenvector accuracy is in doubt.  This message
     is printed only when the off-diagonal terms of the modal mass matrix
     are larger than 1.0E-10. The eigenvectors are not orthogonal to this
     extent.  This nonorthogonality is especially important if a modal
     formulation is used. The pair of eigenvectors listed exhibit the worst
     behavior.  The number failed is the number of pairs above the criteria.
     You can improve the numerical conditioning of the problem by reducing the
     range of mass ratios, stiffness ratios, and eigenvalue range.

 *** USER FATAL MESSAGE 4405 (PRTPRN)
     NO EIGENVECTORS COMPUTED FOR COMPONENT MODE SYNTHESIS OR SYSTEM SOLUTION.
     User information:
     The eigenvectors computed in component mode synthesis (CMS) are
     used to approximate the motion of the component.  Some vectors must
     be present to perform this reduction. For the system solution, an
     exit is taken if eigenvalues are requested but not eigenvectors.
     Reset the "range of frequency" and/or the "number desired" on the EIGR
     EIGR or EIGRL entry.  If the superelement does not have any eigenvalues
     in the range of interest, remove the CMS request for that particular
     superelement.
  
     This message is also issued when the eigenvectors calculated with a
     transformation method such as GIV do not pass internal orthogonality
     checks.  This is indicative of a modeling error.
  
     This message can also be issued if insufficient memory is available
     for the Lanczos method with sparse decomposition.
  
     This could occur with UFM 5401 and be related to UWM 5411.

 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 4425 (PRTPRN)
     ONE OR MORE FATAL ERRORS HAVE OCCURRED.  THERE MAY BE MORE ERROR MESSAGES IN THE PRECEDING OUTPUT
     User information:
     One or more modules has found a fatal error condition.  A message is
     printed for each fatal error condition.  They have set a flag, which
     causes this message to be printed at the end of the run.  Error messages
     may occur anywhere in the output, so you should search your output for
     these errors (search for FATAL).
  
     This message is most likely when PARAM,ERROR,0 is used.  However,
     this error will be issued in superelement analysis if User Warning
     Message 4698 is also issued.
  
     In cyclic symmetry analysis, if no eigenvalues are found in the
     prescribed frequency range on the EIGR or EIGRL entry for the current
     harmonic, the run will not continue to the next harmonic and the message
     will result.  Instead of selecting a frequency range, input the desired
     number of modes.
