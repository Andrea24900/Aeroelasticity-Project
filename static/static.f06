        MAXIMUM RATIO OF MATRIX DIAGONAL TO FACTOR DIAGONAL =  8.4E+14 AT ROW NUMBER         15
     User information:
     One, two or three of the statistics will be printed as follows:
     (1) negative terms on factor  diagonal only if they exist; (2) maximum
     ratio only if it exceeds a threshold defined by the parameter MAXRATIO
     (default 1.0E7);  (3) spill rows only if the problem spills.
  
     Depending on the context, these messages may indicate modeling
     problems. The threshold may be changed with the parameter MAXRATIO,
     however, the user is cautioned against arbitrarily increasing the
     MAXRATIO value just to get the model to run.  The cause of large
     MAXRATIOs should be investigated.
  
     This message is also generated (though the text is slightly different)
     when a Sturm check is performed during eigenvalue extraction. For this
     case, the message does not generally indicate a modeling problem.
  
     See the MSC NASTRAN Installation and Operation Instructions for
     a discussion of these statistics.  See also the MSC NASTRAN Numerical
     Methods User's Guide.

     USER INFORMATION:
     THIS MESSAGE MAY BE IGNORED IF NO GRID POINT IDS OR HIGH RATIO MESSAGES APPEAR IN THE TABLE ON THE NEXT PAGE.
  
     User information:
     During decomposition, the degrees of freedom listed have pivot
     ratios that are that are greater than maxratio or are negative.
     Verify that the degrees of freedom are not part of a mechanism
     and that elements do not have excessive stiffness.  In superelement
     analysis this condition causes run termination.  PARAM,BAILOUT may
     be used to continue the run.  See the MSC NASTRAN Numerical Methods
